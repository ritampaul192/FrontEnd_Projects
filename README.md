# Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find my web development projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I explore getters, setters, dynamic UIs, and modern frameworks. From responsive websites to interactive apps, Iâ€™m constantly learning and improving. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute! ðŸš€
